# Blog Managment System
Basically here we made a blog managment system using concept of DSA called linked list.
In this project we are using concept of array of linked list, which means for each user we have a head of linked list whenever user post blog it's add in his linked list respectively. 
Using linked list we can easily preview the blog and give acess to change and delete his own blog. 
you can use this project in your pbl for you college.
Special features: It not losts there data when you terminate the program it's stroe the data in file. whenever you re compile it, it fetch the data and display all the content. Fot this we use file handling and we are storing the data in csv file i.e comma seperated value which help us to track the data.
THANK YOU.
